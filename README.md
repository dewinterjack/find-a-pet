# Find a pet
Browse through a catalogue of adoptable pets.

Given a dataset of animals, the app will allow you to view the data, sort through it (clicking on titles in the table). Resizable columns and rows change color on hover. 

This is my first web application! I enjoyed learning about using web tech and especially deployment üòÅ

Split up main app component into seperate, readable React componenents.
